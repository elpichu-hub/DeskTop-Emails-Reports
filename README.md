# DeskTop-Emails-Reports
Tool to Generate Different Reports Through a Desktop App and Automated Through Emails

Project Overview Welcome to my project repository! This project showcases the application of powerful tools and technologies to create efficient reports for a past employer. 
By harnessing the capabilities of Pandas, openpyxl, and PyQt5, I have developed a suite of reports that have the potential to revolutionize the way my former company manages its data and operations.

Technologies Used Pandas: The Pandas library provides robust data manipulation and analysis capabilities. It plays a central role in handling and processing the underlying data for the reports.

openpyxl: openpyxl enables the seamless interaction with Excel spreadsheets. Leveraging this library, I've been able to generate and update Excel reports with precision and ease.

PyQt5: PyQt5 powers the graphical user interface of the application, providing an intuitive and user-friendly environment to interact with and generate the reports.

imaplib: The imaplib library facilitates the interaction with IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) servers, enabling functionalities such as retrieving and managing email messages.

os: The os module provides a way to interact with the operating system's file system and environment variables, allowing for efficient file manipulation and management.

logging: The logging module offers a versatile logging system to capture and manage log messages, aiding in the debugging and monitoring of the application.

Email Automation Additionally, this project includes an email automation component that further enhances productivity:

Automated Email Processing: Part of the project involves automating the process of checking emails and executing specific actions based on the information received. 
This feature utilizes the imaplib library to interact with email servers and streamline tasks that involve email communication.
Key Achievements Throughout the development of this project, my primary goal was to streamline and automate the reporting process for my former employer. By implementing this solution, I've aimed to:

Enhance Efficiency: The reports created through this project are designed to save the company valuable time and effort. By automating tasks that used to take hours daily, the project contributes to increased operational efficiency.

Reduce Errors: With manual processes come the potential for human errors. By leveraging automation and data validation features, the project seeks to minimize the likelihood of mistakes in the reporting process.
